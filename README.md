This project was created for the [Restaurant Page Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it by adding mobile responsiveness.

### Objectives

1. Build a basic restaurant web page.
2. Install dependencies using npm.
3. Import resources and assets using Webpack.
4. Use JS modules for each individual tab on the page.
5. Ship the build using Webpack.

### Scope Creep

* Add mobile responsiveness.
